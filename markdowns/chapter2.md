# Basic operations

We will see:
1. Board representation, the correlation between a 2D board and a 64bits integer
2. Coordinates definition. There is in fact several ways of defining coordinates (cartesian, bit position or bitboard).
3. [Accessing and setting](markdowns/single_cell_operations.md) values at coordinates.
